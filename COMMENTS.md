# put your "I would have done this with more time"-style comments here

- Completed in fits and starts (looking after a poorly three year old!) but used roughly two hours.

## With more time I would:

- Add some basic CSS
- Implement some form validation
- Implement robust error handling
- Implement pending states
- Implement a superior cache (ran out of time)
